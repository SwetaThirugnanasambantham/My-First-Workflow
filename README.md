This workflow runs on a schedule and fetches data from an API using an HTTP request.  
The data is processed with JavaScript and checked using conditions to decide the next step.  
Valid data is saved into Airtable, while specific cases trigger a message sent to Discord.  
It automates monitoring, data handling, and notifications without manual effort.
